# Introduction

## About this Workshop

In this workshop we will go over the steps to integrate your container application code with OCI Logging and Management Services.  We will also introduce native search and alarm capabilities for the log and metric data ingested by these services.  

Containerized applications and distributed microservices are quickly becoming the preferred platforms for cloud application development.  Due to the ephemeral nature of containers and the extra layer of runtime abstraction it can be challenging, and distracting, to hook up centralized logging and monitoring services covering your application code.

The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Logging and Monitoring services are comprehensive, highly scalable, fully managed and already integrated with most infrastructure platforms and services. You can easily enable your custom applications to leverage these built-in services and profit from a single, unified observability platform.

We will use Oracle Kubernetes Engine (OKE) to deploy code examples.    


Estimated Time: 45 minutes

### About Product/Technology
Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) offers a fully managed Logging service which is a highly scalable log management and search platform that simplifies collecting, managing, and exploring your logs.

OCI also presents a fully-managed monitoring service enabling you to actively and passively monitor your cloud resources using the Metrics and Alarms features
