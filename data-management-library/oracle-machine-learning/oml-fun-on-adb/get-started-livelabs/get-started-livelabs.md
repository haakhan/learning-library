# Get started with Free Tier Setup

## Introduction
This lab walks you through the steps to set up your free tier environment that includes provisioning an Oracle Autonomous Database, and signing into Oracle Machine Learning user interface.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab, you will learn how to:

* Provision an Oracle Autonomous Database
* Create an Oracle Machine Learning user
* Sign into Oracle Machine Learning user interface
* Create the CUSTOMERS360 table.

	>**Note:** You will use this table in the lab on AutoML UI and OML Services.

### Prerequisites
* Sign up for a free tier Oracle Cloud account.

> **Note:** You may see differences in account details (eg: Compartment Name is different in different places) as you work through the labs. This is because the workshop was developed using different accounts over time.


## Task 1: Provision an Oracle Autonomous Database

To provision an Oracle Autonomous Database:

1. Sign into your OCI account, and under the Launch Resources section, click **Create an ADW database**.

	![Create ADW Database](images/adw_database.png)

	 Alternatively, you may click the left navigation pane on the upper left corner, and click **Autonomous Data Warehouse**.

	![Autonomous Data Warehouse option under Oracle Database](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oracle/learning-library/master/common/images/console/database-adw.png "Autonomous Data Warehouse option under Oracle Database")

2. From the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Console, on the Oracle Autonomous Database page choose your region and select a compartment. Click **Create Autonomous Database**. This opens the Create Autonomous Database page.

4. On the Create Autonomous Database page, provide the basic information about the database. By default, a database name and a display name for the database are provided. You can modify these names to enter a user-friendly display name for the ADB instance to easily identify the resource. The display name does not have to be unique.

5. For Workload Type, click **Data Warehouse**.

6. For Deployment, select **Shared Infrastructure**.

7. For Database Configuration, select Always Free. For the Always Free option, the database configuration options - OCPU count, Storage, and Auto scaling are not available. You must upgrade to a paid account to avail of it.

	 >**Note:** You can create Always Free resources both in Free Tier and Paid accounts

8. Create your Autonomous Database administrator credentials by providing a password. You will need these credentials to sign in to this Autonomous Database instance.   

	>Note: The default administrator username is ADMIN.

9. For network access, select **Allow secure access from everywhere.**

10. For License, select **License Included**.

    ![License settings](images/create-adw-license.png)

11. Click **Create Autonomous Database**. The Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse instance starts provisioning. Once your Autonomous Database is created, the database details are listed with the status Available.

This completes the task of provisioning an Oracle Autonomous Database.

## Task 2: Create an Oracle Machine Learning user

An administrator creates a new user account and user credentials for Oracle Machine Learning in the User Management interface.

>**Note:** You must have the administrator role to access the Oracle Machine Learning User Management interface.

To create a user account:

1. Sign in to your OCI account, click the hamgurger on the left to open the left navigation pane, and click **Autonomous Data Warehouse**.

2. Click on an Autonomous Database instance.   

	![Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse](images/adb_instance.png)


3. On the Autonomous Database Details page, click **Service Console**.

	![Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse](images/service-console.png)


4. On the Service Console click **Administration**.

	![Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse](images/administration.png)


5. Click **Manage Oracle ML Users** to open the Oracle Machine Learning User Administration page.

	![Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse](images/manage_oml_users.png)

6. On the Oracle Machine Learning User Administration Sign in page, enter the username and password to sign in.

	>**Note:** The username is ADMIN. The password is what is you have defined while provisioning the Autonomous Database instance.

7. Click **Create** on the Oracle Machine Learning User Administration page.

	![Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse](images/oml_um_page.png)

7. On the Create User page, enter the following details to create the user:

	![Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse](images/create_user.png)

	* **Username:** Enter a username for the account. Using the username, the user will log in to an Oracle Machine Learning instance.
	* **First Name:** Enter the first name of the user.
	* **Last Name:**  Enter the first name of the user.
	* **Email Address:** Enter the email ID of the user.
	* Select the option **Generate password and email account details to user. User will be required to reset the password on first sign in** to auto generate a temporary password and send an email with the account credentials to the user. If you select this option, you need not enter values in the Password and Confirm Password fields; the fields are grayed out.
	* **Password:** Enter a password for the user, if you choose to create a password for the user.
	>**Note:** This option is disabled if you select the **Generate password...** option to auto generate a temporary password for the user.

	* **Confirm Password:** Enter a password to confirm the value that you entered in the Password field. By doing so, you create the password for the user. The user can change the password when first logging in.

8. Click **Create**.

This completes the task of creating an Oracle Machine Learning user.

## Task 3: Sign into Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks

A notebook is a web-based interface for data analysis, data discovery, data visualization, and collaboration. You create and run notebooks in Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks. You can access Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks from Autonomous Database.

1. From the tab on your browser with your ADW instance, click **Service Console**, then select **Development** on the left.

	![Development option in ADW Service Console](images/adw_development.png)


2. Click **Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks.**

	 ![Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks in ADW](images/oml_notebooks_dev.png)

3. Enter your user credentials and click **Sign in**.

	>**Note:** The credential is what you have defined while creating the Oracle Machine Learning user.

	![Oracle Machine Learning Notebooks Sign in page](images/omluser_signin.png)

4. Click **Notebooks** in the Quick Actions section.

	![Notebooks option in OML homepage](images/homepage_notebooks.png)

This completes the task of signing into Oracle Machine Learning user interface.

## Task 4: Create the CUSTOMERS360 table

In this step, you will create a notebook and run a SQL query to create the table ``CUSTOMERS60``.

>**Note:** You will be using the table CUSTOMERS360 in the lab titled "Using Oracle Machine Learning Services".

To create the table:

1. On the Oracle Machine Learning user interface home page, click **Notebooks**. The Notebooks page opens.

2. On the Notebooks page, click **Create**.

3. In the Create Notebook dialog, enter Customers_360 in the name field. and click **OK**.

4. Type ``%sql`` to connect to the SQL interpreter and press enter.

5. Enter the following script and click the run icon:

    ```
    <copy>
		CREATE TABLE CUSTOMERS360 AS
              (SELECT a.CUST_ID, a.CUST_GENDER, a.CUST_MARITAL_STATUS,
                 a.CUST_YEAR_OF_BIRTH, a.CUST_INCOME_LEVEL, a.CUST_CREDIT_LIMIT,
                 b.EDUCATION, b.AFFINITY_CARD,
                 b.HOUSEHOLD_SIZE, b.OCCUPATION, b.YRS_RESIDENCE, b.Y_BOX_GAMES
           FROM SH.CUSTOMERS a, SH.SUPPLEMENTARY_DEMOGRAPHICS b
           WHERE a.CUST_ID = b.CUST_ID);
		</copy>
    ```

	![SQL script to create Customers360 table](images/sql_script.png)

6. In the next paragraph, run the following script to view the data:

	```
		<copy>
		select * from CUSTOMERS360
			where rownum < 10;
		 </copy>
	 ```
