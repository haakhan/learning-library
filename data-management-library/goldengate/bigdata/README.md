## Oracle Goldengate for Big Data Microservices Workshop

Welcome to the Golden Gate for Big Data Workshop. The content will give you a basic understanding of Golden Gate and Big Data.

## Introduction

The GoldenGate for Big Data Workshop is designed to introduce replication capabilities from relational sources to “Big Data” targets, specifically HDFS, Hive, HBase, Kafka and Cassandra. This workshop is based on GoldenGate for Big Data and GG Microservices which covers all GG supported Big Data targets, except Flume. Additional targets may be supported using open-source pluggable adapters. For more information, please discuss this with the workshop facilitator or the Data Integration Sales team.
