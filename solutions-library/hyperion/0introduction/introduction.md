# Introduction: Deploying Hyperion on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure

## About this Workshop

Hyperion EPM is an Oracle Enterprise Performance Management suite of apps under the domains of Hyperion Financial Management and Hyperion Planning.

Oracle Hyperion Financial Management provides financial consolidation and reporting, while Hyperion Planning is a centralized planning, budgeting, and forecasting solution that integrates financial and operational planning processes and improves business predictability.

Hyperion EPM can be moved to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) for improved efficiency, cost savings, and performance gains compared to on-premises deployments or other clouds. Deploying Hyperion on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure provides access to high-performance compute, Oracle RAC, and Exadata, helping ensure the highest levels of performance availability. Ensuring there is no single point of failure.

When migrating from on-premises, you will take advantage of cloud-based features and web-based tooling such as provisioning and automation of application deployment built by the Hyperion development team. Any currently supported Hyperion version can effectively run on Oracle Cloud.

By moving to OCI, customers gain economic and operational savings with improved elasticity, agility and cost savings while maintaining key customizations and integrations optimized alongside Hyperion.

The goal of this workshop is to help you get comfortable using Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and help you deploy all the resources required for Hyperion to run on OCI.

**Estimated Time: 2 hours 30 minutes**

### Objectives

In this workshop, you will:
* Utilize OCI Resource Manager (ORM) stacks and Terraform configuration to set up Hyperion infrastructure
* Configure the Hyperion VM instances that Terraform provisions
* Optionally, configure a shared file system for all Hyperion instances

### Prerequisites

This lab assumes you have:
* An Oracle account and tenancy provisioned
* If you do not have these provisioned, go through the lab "Getting Started" on the sidebar to enable an OCI environment.
  * If you do already have these provisioned, you may start on Lab 1.
